# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set it up to run on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and repository name.

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```sh
cd your-repo-name
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and you can view your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
